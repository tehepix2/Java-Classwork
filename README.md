Finding prime numbers is a common technical challenge

As you know, a prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself.

For example, 2,3,5,7 are prime numbers, but 4,8,9 are not prime numbers.

Your task is to build a class PrimeDirective that takes an int array as a parameter and creates an arrayList of the prime numbers in the array. Return the arrayList from the PrimeDirective method, and print from main..

The main() should ask the user if a new array is to be entered.  If yes, then ask the user how many numbers to enter, and create the array of that size.  The user enters the integers, some prime and some not, and when the array is finished, the method in PrimeDirective is called.  

When complete, the program asks the user if a new array is to be entered.  If yes, the process repeats,  If no, the program exits.

Donâ€™t worry about making it efficient - just make it work.
