Inheritance Practice

Create a superclass called Person.  From that inherit into a subclass called SchoolPerson.  That will be the superclass for a set of subclasses - Teacher, Administrator, Student, Maintenance.

Each level should have its own constructors.  Also, demonstrate overriding and polymorphism.  One example might be to have a speak() method in SchooPerson, and a different speak() method in each child class.
