Roman Numeral Converter


Carlos Landaverde


For this lab, your aim is to write a program used to convert whole numbers (integer) into roman numerals and vice versa.

Your code should include a module to take a Roman numeral as input and convert and  display the equivalent base 10 integer, and a module to input a base 10 integer and convert it to a Roman numeral and display the result.

You should also include a module to verify that the Roman numeral you input is actually a proper Roman numeral.   For example, it should not contain any characters other than I, V, X, L, C, and M.

You can assume that all inputs are non-negative integers

Please paste your code, several examples of output, and a link to your rep.it below.
