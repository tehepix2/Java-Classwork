# Java-Classwork
Java assignments
Design and implement classes that represent people in a school.  Start with a person superclass, then subclasses for Teacher, Administrator, Student, and Staff.  

If a variable or method is repeated in each child class, it probably belongs in the parent class.  Have at least two variables and two methods in each class.  Also, have one additional method that is overridden in the child classes.
